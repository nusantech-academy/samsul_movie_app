        Mulan is a 2020 American fantasy action drama film produced by Walt
        Disney Pictures. Directed by Niki Caro from a screenplay by Rick Jaffa,
        Amanda Silver, Lauren Hynek, and Elizabeth Martin, it is a live-action
        adaptation of Disney's 1998 film of the same name, itself based on the
        Chinese folklore story Ballad of Mulan. The film stars Yifei Liu in the
        title role, alongside Donnie Yen, Tzi Ma, Jason Scott Lee, Yoson An, Ron
        Yuan, Gong Li, and Jet Li in supporting roles. In the film, Hua Mulan,
        the eldest daughter of an honored warrior, masquerades as a man to take
        her ailing father's place during a general conscription to counter the
        Rouran army in Imperial China. Plans for a live-action remake began in
        2010 but the project stalled in "development hell" for most of the
        decade. Filming took place in New Zealand and China from August to
        November 2018. Over the course of production, the film was the subject
        of several controversies, including changes to the source material and
        filming in Xinjiang in light of the Uyghur genocide and Xinjiang
        internment camps. The film also received criticism for its production
        team largely consisting of people of non-Chinese descent. This included
        the hiring of Caro, rather than an Asian director. Mulan held its world
        premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on March 9, 2020. The film
        was originally scheduled for a wide theatrical release later that month,
        but was cancelled in the United States after being delayed several times
        due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, the film was released on
        September 4, 2020 by Disney+ for a premium fee known as Premier Access
        in countries where the service had launched.[6] The film had a
        traditional theatrical release in countries without Disney+ where
        theaters had re-opened.
