        Peninsula (Korean: 반도; Hanja: 半島; RR: Bando; marketed in North
        America, British Isles and India as Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula)
        is a 2020 South Korean action horror heist film directed by Yeon
        Sang-ho.[4][5] It is a standalone sequel to the 2016 film Train to Busan
        and follows a former soldier who is sent along with a team to retrieve a
        truck full of money from the wastelands of the Korean peninsula now
        inhabited by zombies, rogue militia, and a family. Peninsula was chosen
        to be shown in the Official Selection of the 2020 Cannes Film Festival,
        which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was shown in
        the Panorama section of 25th Busan International Film Festival on
        October 21, 2020.[6] The film was released in South Korea on 15 July
        2020. It has grossed $42.7 million worldwide, but received generally
        mixed reviews from critics, who found it inferior to the first film.
