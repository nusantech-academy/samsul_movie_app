        Luca is a 2021 American computer-animated coming-of-age fantasy film
        produced by Pixar Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney
        Studios Motion Pictures. The film was directed by Enrico Casarosa (in
        his feature-length directorial debut), written by Jesse Andrews and Mike
        Jones, from a story by Casarosa, Andrews, and Simon Stephenson, produced
        by Andrea Warren, and features the voices of Jacob Tremblay and Jack
        Dylan Grazer, with Emma Berman, Saverio Raimondo, Marco Barricelli, Maya
        Rudolph, Jim Gaffigan, Peter Sohn, Lorenzo Crisci, Marina Massironi, and
        Sandy Martin in supporting roles. Set on the Italian Riviera, the film
        centers on Luca Paguro, a young sea monster boy with the ability to
        assume human form while on land, who explores the town of Portorosso
        with his new best friend, Alberto Scorfano, experiencing a life-changing
        summer adventure.[4] Luca takes inspiration from Casarosa's childhood in
        Genoa; several Pixar artists were sent to the Italian Riviera gathering
        research from Italian culture and environment. The sea monsters, a
        "metaphor for feeling different", were loosely based on old Italian
        regional myths and folklore.[5][6] Like La Luna, the design and
        animation were inspired by hand-drawn and stop motion works and Hayao
        Miyazaki's style. Casarosa described the result as a film that "pays
        homage to Federico Fellini and other classic Italian filmmakers, with a
        dash of Miyazaki in the mix too"
