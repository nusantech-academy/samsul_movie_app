        Spider-Man: No Way Home is a 2021 American superhero film based on the
        Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures and
        Marvel Studios and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the
        sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home
        (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The
        film was directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik
        Sommers. It stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside
        Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx,
        Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei,
        Andrew Garfield, and Tobey Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen
        Strange (Cumberbatch) to use magic to make his Spider-Man identity a
        secret again following its public revelation at the end of Far From
        Home. When the spell goes wrong, the multiverse is broken open which
        allows visitors from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe. A
        third MCU Spider-Man film was planned during the production of
        Homecoming in 2017. Negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to
        alter their deal—in which they produce the Spider-Man films
        together—ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project in August 2019,
        but a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the companies a
        month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return,
        and filming took place from October 2020 to March 2021 in New York City
        and Atlanta. No Way Home features several actors reprising their roles
        from the earlier, non-MCU Spider-Man films that were directed by Sam
        Raimi and Marc Webb. The return of previous Spider-Man actors Maguire
        and Garfield was the subject of wide speculation and numerous leaks
        despite the efforts of Sony, Marvel, and the cast to conceal their
        involvement.
