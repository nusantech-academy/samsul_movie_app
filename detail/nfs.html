        Need for Speed is a 2014 action thriller film directed and co-edited by
        Scott Waugh and written by George and John Gatins. It is the film
        adaptation of the racing video game franchise of the same name by
        Electronic Arts. The film stars Aaron Paul, Dominic Cooper, Scott
        Mescudi, Imogen Poots, Ramón Rodríguez, and Michael Keaton. It tells the
        story of street racer Tobey Marshall, who sets off to race cross-country
        as a way of avenging his friend's death at the hands of a rival racer,
        Dino Brewster. Need for Speed was released by Touchstone Pictures on
        March 14, 2014, in 3D, IMAX 3D, and conventional theaters. After its
        release, the film received generally negative reviews, criticized for
        its direction, nonsensical story, and unrealistic action scenes, though
        some praise for Paul's acting. The movie grossed $203 million worldwide.
