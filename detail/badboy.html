        Bad Boys for Life is a 2020 American action comedy film. It is the third
        installment in the Bad Boys franchise, and a standalone sequel to Bad
        Boys II (2003). Directed by Adil & Bilall and written by Chris Bremner,
        Peter Craig and Joe Carnahan, the film sees Will Smith (who also serves
        as producer), Martin Lawrence, and Joe Pantoliano reprise their roles
        from the previous films, with Paola Núñez, Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander
        Ludwig, Charles Melton, Kate del Castillo, and Nicky Jam joining the
        cast as new characters. It was produced by Smith, Jerry Bruckheimer, and
        Doug Belgrad. In Bad Boys for Life, Miami detectives Mike Lowrey and
        Marcus Burnett investigate a string of murders tied to Lowrey's troubled
        past. A third Bad Boys film had been discussed over the years after the
        release of the second in 2003, with Michael Bay stating he would be
        interested in returning to direct, but budgetary constraints made going
        ahead difficult. The film went through several attempts to enter
        production over the course of a decade, with a variety of writers and
        directors attached. The project was eventually finalized and green-lit
        in October 2018, and filming began the following year, lasting from
        January to June 2019. Principal photography took place in Atlanta,
        Miami, and Mexico City.
